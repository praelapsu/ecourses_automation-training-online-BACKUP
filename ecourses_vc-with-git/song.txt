Deep Red

Lying
Thinking
Ceiling
Falling

I need to erase you
From my head
And stop recalling
The deep red

This glass is broken
Cut my skin
I am still bleeding
From within

I want to replace you
With a sin
Fall down with its sweetness
Live in dream

The sound of the city
Telling me
It keeps repeating
Leave it here
